## Simple Summary

The proposal support the overall vision of Boost & rewards the people who have held boost through thick & thin & the believers

## Abstract

Use $50k from the current treasury of $150k to buy back boost. Devs can decide how to do this before the start of new pool immediately after all other pools end on Oct 1 2020
The bought back boost goes into a pool where 100% boost stakers can get rewards for staking
The pool will farm for 2 weeks starting Oct 1
Booster mechanisms apply to the new pool as well.

## Motivation

The proposed idea solves/helps with multiple issues.

Some sort of sell pressure will be relieved. The new pool stakers will need to stake 100% of their boost tokens in return for the boost tokens which are put into the pool by buying back.
The proposal helps team time till Oct 14 to get the bVaults out with audited contracts & does also rewards the believers of this project.
