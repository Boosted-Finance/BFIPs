    Title: Funding for Contract Audits and Development
    Author: Boosted Finance Core Contributors

## Simple Summary
 
The Boosted Finance team is requesting for funding of 60,000 yCRV to bootstrap an ecosystem fund for the payment of contract audits and fast-tracking the development resources required to construct BoostVaults (bVaults), optimize the existing booster mechanism, or other governance proposals to be passed by the community.
 
## Abstract
 
The Boosted Finance team proposes the following measures to be implemented using the funding requested from the treasury:
 
~20,000 yCRV for smart contract audits. Auditing firm to be used TBD.
~35,000 yCRV to be used to compensate the developers and the Boosted Finance team for their work in the fairest way possible, as they undergo development for the new `Governance` and `bVault` contracts.
~2,000 yCRV to be used for server and development costs, e.g. hosting, domains etc.
The remaining ~3,000 yCRV tokens will be used for miscellaneous and unexpected expenses should the need arise (e.g. liquidity pool set up, gas fees, smart contract deployment).
 
Under the assumption that the upcoming bVaults proposal will pass, the timeline for development and a completed security audit is in October, aligning the conclusion of the Wave 3 BOOST distribution.
 
## Motivation
 
Our motivation for submitting this proposal is to ensure enough resources allocated for the development and auditing of the new `Governance` and `bVault` contracts. We believe this is the best path forward, but it is up to the community to decide.
