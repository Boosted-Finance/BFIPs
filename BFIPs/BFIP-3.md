## Simple Summary
 
The Boosted Finance team is requesting the migration and transfer of funds from the previous BoostGov (`0xc3859cb576f7e8a0a8537a5ce4700c95802daf81`) contract to the latest TreasuryV2 (`0x11dc7E94EBf4f55043fc1727cC9B4e23996B9552`) contract.
 
## Abstract
 
The Boosted Finance team proposes a treasury migration with the following details:
 
- ~70,000 yCRV is held in the previous BoostGov contract that needs to be migrated to the latest TreasuryV2 contract.

- The TreasuryV2 contract is an enhancement from BoostGov as it allows the Boosted Finance ecosystem to have an ecosystem fund to b used for various activities.

- All bugs found in the prior Treasury contract have been fixed in TreasuryV2, as disclosed on our prior blog post (https://medium.com/@BoostedFinance/boosted-finance-internal-audit-results-all-bugs-resolved-24c0af5fcdf7).
 
## Motivation
 
This proposal a fair voting process to ensure that the funding and treasury migration is transparent to the community.
