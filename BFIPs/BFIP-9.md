    BFIP: 9
    Title: New Proposal for Wave 3 Allocation

## Simple Summary

This is a counter proposal to BFIP-5 to BFIP-8. I propose 4 pools with the following weight:
- BOOST-ETH Uniswap LP Token: 10,000 BOOST
- BOOST-DAI Uniswap LP Token: 5,000 BOOST
- BOOST-DAI Balancer LP Token: 5,000 BOOST
- 5 pools of equal weight using YFI, COMP, MKR, DXD and BAL (2,000 BOOST each pool) with 90/10 Balancer pools, where the 10% is BOOST.

## Abstract

The core strengths of BOOST are fair distribution and governance, and the first that come to mind are YFI, COMP, MKR, DXD. Since we will be incentivizing BOOST-PAIR pools on Balancer, also propose to add BAL. 

Proposed more weight to the BOOST-ETH and BOOST-DAI pools which will have majority of the liquidity.
